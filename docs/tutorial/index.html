                This will allow you to use all components with ease in any
                project if you include this in the head of the HTML. It can be
                included after the body but this can result in flashes on load,
                as unknown components will be rendered as if they were plain
                text by your browser.

                It would be recommended to include a version number, so as it
                avoid any risk of breaking changes in the future.

                If you want to bundle the components in with your own code then
                you can download the deliverable from NPM. It is a standalone
                module with dependencies bundled in so this will not improve
                your deliverable size.

                If you want to make updates or bundle the components within your
                own app, whilst allowing for tree shaking and optimisations
                during minimisation, you could build from source.

                in order to compile the components. Currently, wholemeal
                contains no methods for including none component code, however
                adding a standard TypeScript file to the "templates" part of the
                project json should compile as a workaround.

                While this may work, I do not recommend it as the component
                library is rather clever about asynchronously loading in content
                that is from large external libraries and the extra work will
                probably not result in better performance.

                A better method would be to include the CDN link for this in
                your head tag and then including your behaviour elsewhere.
