              Bakery should work out of the box with most frameworks. It has
              been tested with Preact and React and typings have been provided
              for both. These have been generated with Wholemeal (the tool used
              to create these components) but the compiler can be adapted to
              make more typings if required.

              For working with React, there are some issues when working with
              web components. These have been navigated already and can be fixed
              by importing "@ipheion/bakery/react". This exports a
              component for each one in Bakery and provides an adapter for all
              document events and properties. It has also been generated via
              Wholemeal.

              Another TypeScript file has been generated for Preact in the same
              location. It does not provide a wrapper because that is not needed
              for Preact to operate.
